    m_Localized: "In the 16th century, the Hanseatic League had increasingly lost
      its importance. Instead, the Scandinavian royal houses, Russian principalities
      and England were now fighting for supremacy in the North and Baltic Seas.\r\n\r\nL\xFCbeck
      in particular - the old center of the Hanseatic League - gradually lost its
      position. But does this really mean that Lvbeca has to disappear from the map
      altogether?"

    m_Localized: 'Navigation at sea was difficult at that time. The compass had only
      become widespread since the 15th century, and the sextant was still almost
      200 years away.

      

      The compass, on the other hand, was already
      known and appreciated as a navigational aid, measuring not only German, but
      also Swedish and English miles on the map. Even today, compasses are still
      used in seafaring as aids to navigation.'

      for a ship of his caravan to turn around for him, he had to be lucky enough
      to go overboard with important goods, such as pigs. \n\nOtherwise he would
      become - like this poor guy here - food for the fish. And sometimes also for
      the rays."

      marked as much by mutual trade as by wars.

      

      A nice walk from
      the North Sea to the Baltic Sea was therefore hardly possible without being
      reminded of times of conflict. Especially in the form of the Danewerk near
      Schleswig, which connected the coasts of both seas since about the seventh
      century.'

    m_Localized: Sweden had become the dominant power of the Baltic region in the
      16th century. The map pays tribute to this not only by the sheer size of Scandinavia,
      but also by the prominent depiction of King Gustav I. But what is a ruler of
      Svecia without his crowns?

      region coveted cargo and livestock, because they were able to cope with the
      icy weather. \r\n\r\nAccording to the map, it even seems possible to overtake
      a moving ship with them. But whether the ice is really strong enough to carry
      these sleds from Finland and Sweden?"

    m_Localized: "If one follows the map towards Russia, the depictions of troops
      and battles pile up. The illustrations do not stand for specific conflicts,
      but rather thematize an evolved conflict: \n\nIn the struggle for supremacy
      in the Baltic Sea region, Sweden and the Principality of Moscow repeatedly
      clashed. Their conflict extended into icy Finland, where these horsemen can
      cross the sea thanks to a sheet of ice."

      worshipping the sun and fire and their nomad tents, a legendary hero can be
      seen. He carries his name on runic tablets: \"Starkad, the Swedish pugilist\".
      \r\n\r\nThus, on the one hand, he symbolizes Sweden's claim to power, and on
      the other hand, the written tablets are supposed to prove Sweden's heritage
      as an ancient cultural nation."

    m_Localized: 'Whales were not uncommon in the North Sea and were hunted for opportunity
      for their meat. Nevertheless, they seemed "monstrous" to the people of that
      time. They were believed to be able to pull an entire ship into the abyss and
      to form "disappearing islands" with their huge backs.


      This specimen
      also fell victim to such a confusion. But can one reproach the English sailors
      for not being quite so accurate between ice floes and sea monsters?'

      preventing its imitation and further distribution. The Venetian government
      also issued a corresponding decree. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the verbose text is
      prominently reproduced on the map. But no matter in which direction one reads
      the privileges,\nman-eating giant crayish, don't seem to be mentioned in or
      around them."

      voyage in the year 76 of the sixteenth century with 3 ships, in search of a
      Northwest Passage. But not only weather and mystical mythical creatures were
      a danger for the sailors of the North Sea. Other sailors also preyed on their
      ships.\r\n\r\nOne wonders what the crew of the three-master hailing from L\xFCbeck
      was thinking when they sailed directly towards this battle between Hamburg
      and Scottish crews."

    m_Localized: "Despite the centuries-old tradition of seafaring, the sea remained
      a fearsome force. Not only tools or cargo disappeared in its depths. \n\nEven
      entire ships are said to have been dragged into the depths by maelstroms. No
      wonder that nearby a devil is already sweeping his stable."
