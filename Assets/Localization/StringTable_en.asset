    m_Localized: "In the 16th century, the Hanseatic League had increasingly lost
      its importance. Instead, the Scandinavian royal houses, Russian principalities
      and England were now fighting for supremacy in the North and Baltic Seas.\r\n\r\nL\xFCbeck
      in particular - the old center of the Hanseatic League - gradually lost its
      position. But does this really mean that Lvbeca has to disappear from the map
      altogether?"
