      its importance. Instead, the Scandinavian royal houses, Russian principalities
      and England were now fighting for supremacy in the North and Baltic Seas.\r\n\r\nL\xFCbeck
      in particular - the <b>old center</b> of the Hanseatic League - gradually lost
      its position. But does this really mean that <b>Lvbeca</b> has to disappear

      had only become widespread since the 15th century, and the sextant was still
      200 years away.


      The ''Zirkel'' (German for drawing compass), on the
      other hand, was already known and appreciated as a navigational aid, measuring
      <b>not only German, but also Swedish and Italian miles</b> on the map. Even
      today, this type of compass is still used in seafaring as navigational aid.'

      A <b>nice walk from the

    m_Localized: Sweden had become the dominant power of the Baltic region in the
      16th century. The map pays tribute to this not only by the sheer size of Scandinavia,
      but also by the prominent depiction of King Gustav I. But what is a <b>ruler
      of Svecia</b> without his crowns?

      for their meat. Nevertheless, they seemed "monstrous" to the people of that

      to form "disappearing islands" with their huge backs.
